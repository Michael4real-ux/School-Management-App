## School Management Cli System

Problem Description
You are to model a department using an object oriented programming (OOP) paradigm. A basic school is made up of the following.

•	Staffs

•	Principal

•	Teachers

•	Non-Academic Staffs

•	Students

•	Courses

•	Classes

•	Applicants

Each of these players have various functions/actions which they can perform

•	A teacher can teach a course.

•	A student can take a course.

•	The principal can expel a student etc.

•	A principal can admit applicants based on age.

How will I complete this project?

•	Organise the folders for your module (application), to house both your code base and the tests.

•	Write tests to cover all the methods to be written, before development begins (TDD: Test Driven Development).

•	Make logical assumptions where necessary.

Steps to evaluate.

•	Code

•	At Minimum

•	The right visibility modifiers should be used.

•	The following concepts/constructs should be used as much as possible

•	Encapsulation

•	Inheritance

•	Polymorphism

•	Interfaces/Abstract classes

•	Single Responsibility for classes.

•	Abstraction

•	Aggregation

•	Composition

	•	Test Coverage (~80%)
	•	At Minimum
	•	The tests should cover the methods as well as the conditions/procedures that the methods employed.
